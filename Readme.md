# Rental project

### Objectives
The objective of this project is to practice and learn about different technologies, like
Java new versions, Gradle, etc. For this, I have chosen to work with a simple rental store,
which easily allow me to work with creation, updates and deletion of information without
having to think too much about the business itself and can focus more in the implementation side.

### How to run
In your console, go to the project folder and run ***gradle build***

### Technologies used
* Java 17
* Gradle
* Spring
* Springboot
